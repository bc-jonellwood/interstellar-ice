      <Question
        title="Is cereal soup"
        body="The classification of cereal as soup is a subject of debate and often depends on how one defines soup and its key characteristics. Soup is typically a liquid dish made by combining various ingredients, such as vegetables, meat, or legumes, with broth or water. It's often served hot. Cereal, on the other hand, is a type of food made from grains like wheat, corn, oats, or rice, usually eaten with milk or yogurt. By the traditional definition of soup, cereal wouldn't be considered soup because it doesn't consist of a liquid broth or water base with ingredients cooked together. However, this question often serves as a playful example of how language and categorization can lead to interesting discussions. It's ultimately up to individuals to decide whether they consider cereal to be a type of soup or not based on their own interpretation and perspective."
